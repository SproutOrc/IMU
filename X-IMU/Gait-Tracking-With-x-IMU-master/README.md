Gait-Tracking-With-x-IMU
========================

This is the source code for the foot tracking algorithm demonstrated in Seb Madgwick's "[3D Tracking with IMU"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ijArKE8vKU) video, originally uploaded to YouTube in March 2011.  An [x-IMU](http://www.x-io.co.uk/x-imu) attached to a foot is be used to track position through [dead reckoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning) and integral drift corrected for each time the foot hit the ground.

See the [original post](http://www.x-io.co.uk/gait-tracking-with-x-imu/) for more information.
